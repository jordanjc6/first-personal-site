                    This is a full-stack web application developed for my <br>
                    sister to create and manage her list of funny quotes <br>
                    and conversations from around the house. The front-end <br>
                    was built using Angular and NestJS was used to create <br>
                    the backend. The REST API manages crud operations of <br>
                    conversation entries. Conversations are stored in two <br>
                    PostgreSQL tables: 'quotes' and 'phrases'. The title, <br>
                    context, and speakers are 'quotes' attributes and each <br>
                    quote record is related to the appropriate 'phrase' record <br>
                    by quoteid. Each phrase record records the speaker and text.

                    This is a full-stack web application developed for a <br>
                    small jewelry business that is used to manage inventory <br>
                    and price items. The front-end was made using HTML/CSS + <br>
                    JavaScript and the back-end was built using NestJS. The <br>
                    REST API makes requests to the back-end which communicates <br>
                    with the PostgreSQL DB via TypeORM to perform search and <br>
                    CRUD operations on the jewelry inventory. <a href="https://mcjewelry.herokuapp.com/" target="_blank">Try it!</a>

                    Connect 4 is a terminal-based recreation <br>
                    of the game Connect Four coded in Java. <br>
                    Players take turns placing their tokens <br>
                    on the board by inputting the desired <br>
                    column number. The board GUI was created <br>
                    using Java Swing and this game supports <br>
                    multiplayer.

                    A database of global Covid-19 activity for 2020 was retrieved <br>
                    from <a href="https://data.world/" target="_blank">data.world</a> and stored in SQLite where I used SQL to perform <br>
                    various queries in order to analyze the progression of Covid cases throughout <br>
                    the year. The accompanying graph was created using Tableau and <br>
                    displays the rise of daily cases and deaths in Ontario.
